#✈️ Flight Delay Prediction
Predicting whether a flight will be delayed or not is a complex task influenced by numerous factors, including scheduling, weather, airline efficiency, and air traffic. In this project, we apply machine learning techniques to analyze historical flight data and build predictive models capable of forecasting delays before they happen.

📌 Project Overview
Flight delays can lead to significant financial and operational disruptions for airlines, airports, and passengers. The goal of this project is to:

Analyze flight data to uncover the root causes of delays.

Engineer relevant features that improve predictive power.

Build and evaluate classification models to predict flight delays.

Deliver insights that could assist airlines and passengers in managing expectations and operations more efficiently.

📊 Workflow
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed univariate and multivariate analysis to understand data distribution and correlations.

Visualized delay patterns by airline, airport, time of day, day of week, and month.

Identified data quality issues, such as missing values and anomalies.

2. Feature Engineering
Created binary target variable for delay classification.

Engineered features such as:

Time-based categories (morning, afternoon, evening flights).

Day-of-week indicators.

Distance buckets.

Delay history and frequency by flight number or airline.

3. Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values and outliers.

Encoded categorical variables using label encoding and one-hot encoding.

Scaled numerical features where necessary.

4. Model Building
Built and tuned multiple classification models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost Classifier

Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and cross-validation.

5. Model Evaluation
Evaluated models based on:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

ROC-AUC Curve

Visualized confusion matrices and feature importances.

6. Insights
Identified key predictors of delay: departure time, airline, origin airport, day of the week.

Noted that delays are more common in the evening and with specific carriers or hubs.

🧾 Conclusion
This project demonstrates a practical machine learning approach to predicting flight delays using historical data. By analyzing patterns in time, location, and airline behavior, we were able to build accurate classification models to forecast whether a flight is likely to be delayed.

✅ Key Takeaways:
Prediction Basis:

Scheduled Departure Time: Flights later in the day were more prone to delays, likely due to compounding delays throughout the schedule.

Day of Week & Month: Some days (e.g. Fridays, Mondays) showed higher delay rates due to heavy travel traffic.

Origin & Destination Airports: Busy hubs or airports with frequent weather issues had higher average delays.

Airline Carrier: Certain airlines had a consistent pattern of delay—possibly due to scheduling or fleet management differences.

Distance of Flight: Short-haul flights were more often delayed compared to long-haul, due to tighter turnarounds and more congested routes.

Best Performing Model: XGBoost achieved the best performance in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, thanks to its ability to handle feature interactions and class imbalance effectively.

Feature Importance Analysis showed that the most influential features in predicting delays were:

Airline

Departure hour

Origin airport

Distance

Day of the week

By using these features, the models were able to identify flights at high risk of delay before takeoff, which could be useful for airlines, airports, and passengers in planning and resource allocation.
