# Flight-Delay-Prediction
This project leverages machine learning to predict flight delays using historical flight data. The goal is to build a reliable model that can identify whether a flight is likely to be delayed based on various features like scheduled departure time, airline, origin and destination airports, weather conditions, and more.
